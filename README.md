# DWL
This is an experiment for me to test the usability of Wayland. I will admit, I am impressed with the results, however I will be sticking to X11/dwm for now.

## Patches Applied
```
autostart - allows for the start of programs on launch
movestack - allows windows to be moved through the stack
vanitygaps - gaps between windows for "vanity" purposes
```

## Installation
```sh
make
sudo make install
```
